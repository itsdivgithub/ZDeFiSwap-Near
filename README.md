# ENCODE X NEAR HORIZON 2023

## DEPLOYMENT NEAR ORG-  test.near.org
Introduction:
ZSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that has tackled two significant challenges in the DeFi space: concentrated liquidity and centralized frontends. By enabling liquidity providers to focus on specific price ranges and integrating BOS on NEAR, ZSwap has achieved a fully decentralized and efficient liquidity DEX. However, this journey hasn't been without its challenges, particularly in terms of BOS integration and navigating the intricacies of cross-contract calling on NEAR.

Scaling with Near Protocol:
Scaling ZSwap with Near Protocol is a strategic move aimed at addressing the challenges and seizing new opportunities for growth. Here are our plans for scaling the project:

Leveraging Near's Infrastructure:
Near Protocol offers a highly scalable and efficient blockchain infrastructure that can handle a large number of transactions with low latency. ZSwap intends to harness Near's capabilities to enhance the speed and scalability of the platform, ensuring that users can execute trades quickly and without delays.

Expanding Liquidity Pools:
Near Protocol's smart contract capabilities make it easier to manage and expand liquidity pools. ZSwap plans to introduce more liquidity pairs and incentivize liquidity providers through rewards, attracting a broader range of assets and liquidity to the platform.

Ecosystem Integration:
Near Protocol has a growing ecosystem of DeFi projects and developers. ZSwap will actively engage with this ecosystem to foster collaborations, cross-integrations, and shared liquidity, creating a more interconnected DeFi environment on Near.

User-Friendly Interface:
ZSwap's commitment to decentralization includes providing a user-friendly interface that is easily accessible to both experienced DeFi users and newcomers. The Near ecosystem supports the development of user-friendly dApps, and ZSwap plans to take advantage of this to improve the user experience.

Security and Trustless Operations:
Near Protocol's focus on security and trustless operations aligns well with ZSwap's objectives. As the platform grows, ZSwap will continue to prioritize security by conducting regular audits and enhancing smart contract security.

Bridging to Other Networks:
Near Protocol's bridge capabilities enable interoperability with other blockchain networks. ZSwap intends to explore the possibilities of bridging assets to and from Near, expanding its reach and liquidity sources.

Conclusion:
Scaling with Near Protocol presents an exciting opportunity for ZSwap to address liquidity challenges, enhance user experiences, and tap into a growing DeFi ecosystem. While there have been hurdles along the way, the unique features and potential of Near Protocol offer a promising future for ZSwap as a fully decentralized and efficient liquidity DEX. As we move forward, we remain committed to overcoming challenges and providing innovative solutions to our users within the Near ecosystem.
